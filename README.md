# Culture Globe - powered by Europeana OpenSearch API and WebGL Earth

The project originally for Europeana Hackaton in Vienna

## To start developing 

Download right plovr build (https://code.google.com/p/plovr/downloads/list)

Run:

     make serve

Open in the web browser the file *src/main.html* (with WebGL-enabled browser)

Now you can start to edit the code and just reload the page in browser and the code is recompiled and shown. If there is an error you should see it at the top of the page.
